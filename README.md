# HackAssembler

This is an implementation of the assembler project found in [The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles 2005 edition](https://a.co/d/iUVyYZP). The assembler is written in C#, and it will translate a file containing Hack assembler code into a .hack file containing the corresponding machine code. I used the supplied CPU Emulator to test the resulting binaries, and passed all tests.

Also, I tried to integrate concepts from functional programming using ideas I took from Enrico Buonanno, author of [Functional Programming in C#](https://a.co/d/aWz15c2). Because of that, LaYumba.Functional from his [functional-csharp-code repository](https://github.com/la-yumba/functional-csharp-code.git) is required.

# Purpose

This repository was created just to show my beginning as a programmer. I wrote this in early July of 2020, before I had even begun my journey through a traditional post-secondary education. At that time, I was a self-motivated learner who simply read books, did projects, and then tried other daily programming challenges. With this project, I decided to apply all of the techniques I had been learning about. The result is rudimentary, but I am happy with it. Thank you for reading.
